/*
Write a program that calculates the customerâ€™s monthly bill. IT should input customer name, which package the customer has purchased, and how many minutes and data were used.
 IT should then create a bill that includes the input information and the total amount to pay.
 It should also display how much money package A customers would save if they purchased package B or X, and how much money package B customers would save if they purchased package C.
 If there would be no savings, no message should be printed.
